Space Warp is a mod loader for Kerbal Space Program 2.

Note: Use at your own risk, as this is an early version that is expected to undergo many changes.

## Compiling

To compile this project, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Install NuGet
2. Run `nuget restore` inside the top directory to install the packages.
3. Copy everything in the `Kerbal Space Program 2\KSP2_x64_Data\Managed` folder into the `external_dlls/` folder.
4. Run one of the build scripts (see below for more info) and copy the contents from the correct build output directory into the KSP2 root directory.
5. Launch KSP2 and wait until the title screen appears. You should see a mods folder under the `SpaceWarp` folder.
6. Drag any mods that follow the structure below into that mods folder.

Mods are currently implemented as monobehaviours with two fields: a `Logger` for logging and a `Manager` that points to Spacewarp. A mod template generator exists as a Python script.

## Mod Structure

The mod structure is still a work in progress. However, the current structure is as follows:

* [KSP_ROOT]/SpaceWarp/Mods
  * example_mod
    * modinfo.json
    * README.md
    * assets/
      * bundles/
        * \*
      * assembly/
        * parts/
            * *.json
        * models/
            * *.json
        * resources/
            * *.json
    * bin/
    * config/
    * .ignore (optional, if this file is present, the mod will be skipped!)

## Build Scripts

Each build scripts is essentially just a wrapper around `python3 builder.py $@`. The actual builder code is in `builder.py`.
Before running, open a terminal and `cd` into the repo, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies (its just `argparse`).

The build scripts are:
`build.bat` for Windows, `build.ps1` for Windows (Powershell), and `build.sh` for Linux

The available arguments are:
- `-r` or `--release` to build in release mode
- `-t [target]` or `--target [target]` to build for a specific target (accepted values: `bepinex` or `doorstop`)
- `-a` or `--all` to build for both BepInEx and Doorstop

When building for BepInEx, the build output will be in `build/BepInEx`, and the compressed version will be `build/SpaceWarp-BepInEx-[Debug|Release]-[commit].zip`.

When building for Unity Doorstop (standalone), the build output will be in `build/Doorstop`, and the compressed version will be `build/SpaceWarp-Doorstop-[Debug|Release]-[commit].zip`.
